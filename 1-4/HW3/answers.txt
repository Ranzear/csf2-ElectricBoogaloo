Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

linenum and seq are now undefined, and this throws an error at the beginning of 
the loop. Commenting out gc_count = 0 would let the entire loop run, and then 
throw the undefined error after processing is done, wasting the computation.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852

Reflection:

At one point my solution only counted valid pairs and Problem 4's outputs were 
slightly different. Apparently there are some invalid (not A, T, G, or C) pairs 
snuck in sample_1.fastq. String.rstrip() is rather neat and helps retain those 
invalids without handling newline characters, so I reapplied it. I implemented
a handy-dandy boolean for whether to count invalids or not.

Also, twelve seconds to count both categories versus fifty seconds for just one.

Massive strings result in massive overhead. Process on the fly and, potentially,
in parallel instead. Also, understand your inputs; even wikipedia can tell you
enough about a format to parse it on its own terms.
